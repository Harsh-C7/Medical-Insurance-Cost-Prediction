# Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

This project aims to predict medical insurance costs based on patient demographic information. By analyzing key factors like age, BMI, and smoking status, the model can help insurance providers better understand the drivers of cost variability.

## Project Overview

The notebook walks through the steps involved in building a machine learning model to predict individual insurance charges. It includes:

1. **Data Exploration**:
   - Insights into the distribution of factors (age, BMI, etc.) that influence insurance costs.
   - Visualizations to understand relationships, including distribution plots and count plots for identifying trends.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Encoding categorical features (e.g., gender, region, and smoking status) for compatibility with machine learning models.
   - Normalization and handling of missing values for a clean dataset.

3. **Feature Selection and Model Training**:
   - Regression model is applied i.e linear regression, to assess the effectiveness in predicting costs.
   - Model evaluation with metrics such as R-squared score to gauge performance.

4. **Results and Analysis**:
   - The best performing model is selected and evaluated on test data.
   - Analysis of feature importance and model predictions.
